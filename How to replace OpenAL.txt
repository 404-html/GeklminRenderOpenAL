You need to replace the OpenAL SO file with your own version. 
I believe it's called libal.so

It needs a complete function name table and identical functionality
to OpenAL

you can use SO inspector program to look at the function headers in the
.SO file and figure out what functions you therefore need to replicate.

Documentation of OpenAL's functionality (so you can reproduce it with
your own code) is available on their website:
